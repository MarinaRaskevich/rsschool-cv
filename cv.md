### Brief Self-Introduction
A year ago, I discovered web development and set a goal to become a highly skilled full-stack developer. After completing an intensive 6-month course, I gained a solid foundation in full-stack development and the core technologies in this field. Currently, I'm focused on advancing my technical expertise, broadening my skill set, and deepening my understanding to secure a full-time role in web development.

My background also includes a university degree in Advertising and Public Relations, with additional fluency in French and a strong grasp of English. I am passionate about learning, highly disciplined, and dedicated to continuous improvement in both technical and professional areas.
